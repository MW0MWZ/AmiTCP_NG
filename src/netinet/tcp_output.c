 * HISTORY
 * $Log: tcp_output.c,v $
 * Revision 1.9  1993/06/04  11:16:15  jraja
 * Fixes for first public release.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1993/05/17  00:16:44  ppessi
 * Changed RCS version. Added rcsid.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1993/04/24  23:22:13  jraja
 * Removed #ifdef NOALIGN, now using straight structure copies.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  93/04/13  22:16:32  22:16:32  jraja (Jarno Tapio Rajahalme)
 * Added ALIGNED to the tcp_initopt (which was odd aligned).
 * 
 * Revision 1.5  93/04/05  19:06:32  19:06:32  jraja (Jarno Tapio Rajahalme)
 * Changed storage of the spl functions  return values to type spl_t.
 * Added include for conf.h to every .c file.
 * 
 * Revision 1.4  93/03/22  16:59:39  16:59:39  jraja (Jarno Tapio Rajahalme)
 * Changed bcopy()s and bzero()s with word aligned pointers to
 * aligned_b(copy|zero) ar aligned_b(copy|zero)_const. The latter is for calls
 * in which the size is constant.
 * These can be disabled by defining NOALIGN.
 *  Converted bcopys doing structure copies (on aligned pointers) to structure
 * assignments, since at least SASC produces better code with assignment.
 * 
 * Revision 1.3  93/03/03  21:29:37  21:29:37  jraja (Jarno Tapio Rajahalme)
 * Moved various data definitions from header files to here.
 * 
 * Revision 1.2  93/02/26  09:49:02  09:49:02  jraja (Jarno Tapio Rajahalme)
 * Made this compile with ANSI C (added prototypes).
 * Added one (phony) argument to tcp_quench() call, since it now takes two
 * arguments, but does not use the second.
 * 
 * Revision 1.1  92/11/17  16:30:39  16:30:39  jraja (Jarno Tapio Rajahalme)
 * Initial revision

/*
 * tcp_output.c --- TCP send-side: decide whether to send, and build the segment.
 *
 * Stock 4.4BSD. tcp_output() is called whenever TCP might have something to send --
 * new data from the socket, an ACK owed, a retransmit timer firing, a window
 * update. Its job is to decide IF a segment should go now and, if so, to build it.
 * The interesting policy lives here:
 *   - how much data may be sent = min(send window, congestion window) minus what's
 *     already in flight; Nagle's algorithm (coalescing small sends); the
 *     silly-window-syndrome avoidance;
 *   - which flags/options to set (SYN, FIN, ACK, window scale/MSS at setup);
 *   - persist timer when the window is zero.
 * It assembles the header + a copy of the data mbufs, checksums, and calls
 * ip_output(). See TCP/IP Illustrated Vol 2 chapter 26. Read this after
 * tcp_input.c: input decides "we should respond", output decides "here is what,
 * if anything, to actually put on the wire".
